UTIL-MAINBOARD-CPU_throttle
===========================

Allows CPU throttling (that is adjusting the CPU speed and consequently power consumption) for VIA 686A and 686B south bridges. These south bridges are very common and can be found on almost any modern VIA chipset (Apollo Pro133(A), Pro266, KX133, KT133(A), etc) based motherboard and on many AMD 750/760 based motherboards as well.
